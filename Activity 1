Who are the Notable Inventors of Hardware and Software?

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS:

1. Brian Wilson Kernighan(1942) is a Canadian computer scientist. Kernighan's name became widely known through co authorship of the first book on the C programming language (The C Programming Language) with Dennis Ritchie

2. Kenneth Lane Thompson(1943) is an American pioneer of computer science. Thompson worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he designed and isplesented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the 8 programming language, the direct predecessor to the C language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating system. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-developed the Go language.

3. Willian Henry Gates III(1955) - Bill Gates diversified his fortune from software firs Microsoft into dozens of holdings, including waste disposal firm Republic Services and tractor saker Deere & Co.

4. Guido Van Rossum(1956) is a Dutch programmer. He is the creator of the Python programning language, for which he
was the "benevolent dictator for life" (BOFL)

5. Marc Andreessen(1971) A general partner and co-founder of the Andreessen Horowitz and Netscape, Marc Andreessen is a famous software engineer.  a well-known American investor and entrepreneur. Opsware was among the other creations that he sold to Hewlett-Packard. 

HARDWARE DEVELOPERS:

1. Linus Torvalds(1969) s a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for Linux operating systems (distributions) and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS.

2. Kenneth Lane Thompson(1943) is an American pioneer of computer science. Thompson worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.

3. Niklaus Emil Wirth(1934) was a Swiss computer scientist. He designed several programming languages, including Pascal, and pioneered several classic topics in software engineering.

4. Bjarne Stroustrup(1950) is a Danish computer scientist, known for the development of the C++ programming language.

5. Richard Matthew Stallman(1953) also known by his initials, rms,[1] is an American free software movement activist and programmer.
